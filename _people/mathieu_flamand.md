### Bio

[Mathieu Flamand](https://mflamand.github.io/) runs his lab at the CRCHU de Québec - Université Laval since 2023. He has a long-standing  interest in unravelling the complex mechanisms governing post-transcriptional gene regulation in animals. In particular, his work has focused on 3'UTRs and RNA-binding proteins binding this region to regulate gene expression. \
During his graduate training in Dr Thomas Duchaine’s team at McGill University (PhD in Biochemistry, 2009–2017), he received numerous prestigious awards, including fellowships from the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQS) and NSERC, as well as the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship (CIHR), underscoring his scientific leadership. His PhD thesis focused on exploring the cooperative interplay between RBPs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the control of RNA stability and translation in the nematode _C. elegans_. \
He next joined Duke University Medical Center (DUMC, 2017–2022) for his postdoctoral training during which he was supported by a CIHR fellowship. Under the mentorship of Dr Kate Meyer (Departments of Biochemistry and Neurobiology), a pioneer in the field of RNA modifications. His research focused on the roles and functions of m6A and m6A readers within the nervous system. \
